## Status Markers

Throughout conductor files:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending/New |
| `[~]` | In Progress |
| `[x]` | Completed (often followed by 7-char commit SHA) |
| `[!]` | Blocked (followed by reason in brackets) |
| `[-]` | Skipped (followed by reason) |

## State Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `conductor/setup_state.json` | Track setup progress for resume |
| `conductor/product.md` | Product vision, users, goals |
| `conductor/tech-stack.md` | Technology choices |
| `conductor/workflow.md` | Development workflow (TDD, commits) |
| `conductor/tracks.md` | Master track list with status |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/metadata.json` | Track metadata |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/spec.md` | Requirements |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/plan.md` | Phased task list |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/implement_state.json` | Phase-aware implementation resume state |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/parallel_state.json` | Parallel worker state (for parallel phases) |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/handoff_*.md` | Section handoff documents |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/blockers.md` | Block history log |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/skipped.md` | Skipped tasks log |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/revisions.md` | Revision history log |
| `conductor/refresh_state.json` | Context refresh tracking |
| `conductor/beads.json` | Beads integration config |
| `conductor/archive/` | Archived completed tracks |
| `conductor/exports/` | Exported summaries |

## Parallel Execution Annotations

Plan.md can include annotations for parallel task execution:

| Annotation | Location | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| `<!-- execution: parallel -->` | After phase heading | Enable parallel execution for phase |
| `<!-- files: path1, path2 -->` | After task line | Exclusive file ownership |
| `<!-- depends: task1, task2 -->` | After task line | Task dependencies within phase |
| `<!-- parallel-group: name -->` | After task line | Optional grouping |

## Gemini CLI Compatibility

Projects set up with Gemini CLI's Conductor extension use identical structure.
The only differences are command syntax:

| Gemini CLI | Claude Code |
|------------|-------------|
| `/conductor:setup` | `/conductor-setup` |
| `/conductor:newTrack` | `/conductor-newtrack` |
| `/conductor:implement` | `/conductor-implement` |
| `/conductor:status` | `/conductor-status` |
| `/conductor:revert` | `/conductor-revert` |
| `/conductor:handoff` | `/conductor-handoff` |
| `/conductor:refresh` | `/conductor-refresh` |

Files, workflows, and state management are fully compatible.

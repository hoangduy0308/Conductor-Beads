# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Conductor-Beads is a unified toolkit for **Context-Driven Development** that combines:

- **Conductor**: Spec-first planning, human-readable context, TDD workflow
- **Beads**: Dependency-aware task graph, cross-session memory, agent-optimized output

It works with both Gemini CLI (via extension) and Claude Code (via commands and skills).

### Skills

| Skill | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **conductor** | `.claude/skills/conductor/` | Auto-activates when `conductor/` exists. Provides intent mapping and proactive behaviors. |
| **beads** | `.claude/skills/beads/` | Auto-activates when `.beads/` exists. Provides persistent memory across sessions. |
| **planning** | `.claude/skills/planning/` | Discovery, risk assessment, and spike workflow for complex features. |
| **filing-beads** | `.claude/skills/filing-beads/` | Structured bead creation with dependencies and priorities. |
| **reviewing-beads** | `.claude/skills/reviewing-beads/` | Quality gate for beads before implementation. |
| **orchestrating-beads** | `.claude/skills/orchestrating-beads/` | Multi-agent parallel execution with Agent Mail. |
| **skill-creator** | `.claude/skills/skill-creator/` | Guide for creating new AI agent skills. |

### Planning Pipeline (for complex features)

For large, multi-module features, use the planning skill pipeline instead of classic `/conductor-newtrack`:

```
planning skill → filing-beads → reviewing-beads → /conductor-newtrack --import → orchestrating-beads
```

This provides:
- **Discovery**: Parallel agents explore codebase with gkg, librarian, exa
- **Risk Assessment**: Oracle analyzes gaps, identifies HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risks
- **Spikes**: Validate HIGH risk items before committing to implementation
- **Quality Gate**: reviewing-beads ensures beads are clear and complete
- **Multi-Agent Execution**: orchestrating-beads spawns parallel workers with Agent Mail

### Generated Artifacts (in user projects)

When users run Conductor-Beads, it creates:

```

## Key Concepts

### Tracks
A track is a logical unit of work (feature or bug fix). Each track has:
- Unique ID format: `shortname_YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `auth_20241226`)
- Status markers: `[ ]` new, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` completed, `[!]` blocked, `[-]` skipped
- Own directory with spec, plan, metadata, and state files

### Parallel Execution (New!)
Phases can execute tasks in parallel using sub-agents:
- Annotate phases with `<!-- execution: parallel -->`
- Tasks have `<!-- files: ... -->` for exclusive file ownership
- Use `<!-- depends: taskN -->` for task dependencies
- Coordinator spawns workers via Task() tool
- State tracked in `parallel_state.json`

### Task Workflow (TDD)
1. Select task from plan.md (or use `bd ready` if Beads enabled)
2. Mark `[~]` in progress (sync to Beads: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`)
3. Write failing tests (Red)
4. Implement to pass (Green)
5. Refactor
6. Verify >80% coverage
7. Commit with message format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
8. Update plan.md with commit SHA
9. If Beads: `bd done <id> --note "commit: <sha>"`

**Important:** All commits stay local. Conductor never pushes automatically - users decide when to push.

### Beads Integration
When Beads is enabled (`conductor/beads.json` with `enabled: true`):
- Each track becomes a Beads epic
- Tasks sync to Beads for persistent memory
- `bd ready` finds tasks with no blockers
- Notes survive context compaction
- Graceful degradation if `bd` command fails

### Phase Checkpoints
At phase completion:
- Run full test suite
- Manual verification with user
- Create checkpoint commit

## Development Notes

- Commands are defined as Markdown (`.claude/commands/`) or TOML (`commands/conductor/`)
- Skills use SKILL.md format with references/ subdirectory
- State is tracked in JSON files (setup_state.json, implement_state.json, metadata.json)
- Git notes used for audit trails
- Commands validate setup before executing
- Both Gemini CLI and Claude Code use the same `conductor/` directory structure (interoperable)
